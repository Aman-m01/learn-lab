## `Typescript`

- Typescript is a programming language developed and maintained by the `Microsoft`.
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other powerful features to JavaScript. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with any browser or JavaScript runtime.

## `Why we use TS `

- `Static typing`: It catch erros during developement rather than at runtime.
- Ideal for Large Projects
- Fully Compitable with the existing JS code.
- Better autocompletion ,refactoring and error checking in IDEs.

## `how does TS code run`

- Typescript code never runs in the browser, browsers can only understand JS. Javascript is the runtime language (the things that actually runs on the browser/nodeJS runtime)
- TS is somethings that compiles down to the JS, when the typescript code compiles down to the JS ,you get type checking. if there is an error the conversion to javascript fails.
- `tsc` is the official ts compiler that you can use to convert typescript code into javascript.
